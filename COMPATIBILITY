            == Satori: Libraries and Tools for Epiphany ==

                -- Compatibility --

Satori is written in C# 5.0 and requires an appropriate C# compiler, such as
Microsoft's compiler in .NET Framework 4.5+ or MCS from Mono 3.2.4+.

Building Satori requires either an IDE that can compile MSBuild projects or an
equivalent command line tool, such as MSBuild or XBuild. GNU Make can be used
to build the project conveniently on POSIX systems.

Any operating system and architecture that .NET or Mono can run on should be
supported by Satori, though the hardware interface is only guaranteed to work
on Linux.
