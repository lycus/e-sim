            == e-sim: Epiphany Architecture Simulator ==

                -- Compatibility --

e-sim is written in C# 5.0 and requires an appropriate C# compiler, such as
Microsoft's compiler in .NET Framework 4.5+ or MCS from Mono 3.2.4+.

Building e-sim requires either an IDE that can compile MSBuild projects or an
equivalent command line tool, such as MSBuild or XBuild.

Any operating system and architecture that .NET or Mono can run on should be
supported by e-sim.
