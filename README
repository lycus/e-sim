            == Satori: Libraries and Tools for Epiphany ==

                -- Introduction --

Satori is a Japanese Buddhist term for enlightenment.

Satori consists of two things: A library providing a unified interface for
controlling Epiphany accelerator cores (whether simulated or silicon) and
tools that provide command line interfaces to this functionality.

The library makes it trivial to write host-side applications that can be
executed against real hardware, but also be developed and debugged with
Satori's very fast built-in simulator which features true concurrency for
the simulated cores (unlike the official CGEN simulator by Adapteva). The
library also provides infrastructure for writing host-side kernels, as well
as utilities such as an in-memory assembler and an ELF loader.

The tools make it easy to run compiled ELF programs in both the simulator
and on real hardware. Any ELF program compiled with the official Epiphany
GCC can be executed without any extra steps. The default kernel provided by
Satori is also compatible with the system calls that the Epiphany port of
Newlib uses.
