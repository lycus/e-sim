            == e-sim: Epiphany Architecture Simulator ==

                -- Introduction --

e-sim is a simulator for the Epiphany processor architecture. Unlike the
official CGEN simulator by Adapteva, e-sim features true concurrency and can
simulate a full 4096-core eMesh.

e-sim takes ELF binaries produced by the official Epiphany GCC and executes
them out of the box. No extra steps are necessary. It is compatible with the
system calls described in the Epiphany architecture manual, which are used by
the Newlib C library included in the eSDK.
