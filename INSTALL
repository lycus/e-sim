            == Satori: Libraries and Tools for Epiphany ==

                -- Installation --

Satori uses a standard MSBuild solution. It can be built in any IDE that
understands such files, or with e.g. XBuild:

    $ xbuild Lycus.Satori.sln

An extra parameter can be passed to build in release mode:

    $ xbuild Lycus.Satori.sln /p:Configuration=Release

The final binaries will end up in the bin/Debug or bin/Release directories
within each project directory.

If you are on a POSIX system, you can build with GNU Make as a convenience.
Simply invoke it like so:

    $ make

Or:

    $ make MODE=Release

The binaries will end up in the bin and lib directories.

The available makefile targets are:

    * all: Builds the entire solution.
    * check: Runs the test suite. Builds the solution first if needed.
    * clean: Cleans up the tree (removes compiled binaries).
    * install: Install binaries to the system.
    * uninstall: Uninstall binaries from the system.

The PREFIX variable can be set to tell the install and uninstall targets where
to add/remove files.
