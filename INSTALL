                -- Installation --

e-sim uses a standard MSBuild solution. It can be built in any IDE that
understands such files, or with e.g. XBuild:

    $ xbuild e-sim.sln

An extra parameter can be passed to build in release mode:

    $ xbuild e-sim.sln /p:Configuration=Release

The final binaries will end up in e-sim/bin/Debug or e-sim/bin/Release.
